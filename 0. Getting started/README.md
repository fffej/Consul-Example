# Getting started

Grab the latest version of Consul from [here](https://www.consul.io/downloads.html).

Once you've got it, run `consul.exe --version` and you should see something like this:

> Consul v1.4.4
> Protocol 2 spoken by default, understands 2 to 3 (agent willautomatically use protocol >2 when speaking to compatible agents)

And that's it. No installing anything complicated.
